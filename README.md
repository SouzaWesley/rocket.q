## Some Observations about this App

1 - The project isn't finished! I intend to continue it!
2 - It's not responsive to mobile versions.
3 - If the design doesn't display well, try to zoom out, some screens probably won't work well.

## Functionalities

- You can create as many classes as you want.
- You can share the class' id to your friends.
- There's not a login method, you are anonymous.
